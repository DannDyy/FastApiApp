Some explanations:

In /get/query i set limit in 100, because in default it`s 10

In migrations folder, i tested your code from lection to create cve index, i dont use it in my app

Visualisation in html is the same like in last homework, just adapted.

All logic are prety much the same, but now i use requests (queries) for Elastic searches to get data.
